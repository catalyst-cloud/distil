# Distil

## What

Distil is a web app to provide easy interactions with ERP systems, by exposing a configurable set of collection tools and transformers to make usable billing data out of Ceilometer entries.

Distil provides a rest api to integrate with arbitrary ERP systems, and returns sales orders as json.
What the ranges are, and how Ceilometer data is aggregated is intended to be configurable, and defined in the configuration file.

The Distil data store will prevent overlapping bills for a given tenant and resource ever being stored, while still allowing for regeneration of a given sales order.

## Requirements:

See: requirements.txt

## Configuration

Configuring Distil is handled through its primary configuration file, which defaults to: /etc/distil/conf.yaml

A base configuration is included, but must be modified appropriately. It can be located at: /examples/conf.yaml

### Collection

Under collection > meter_mappings in the configs is how we define the transformers being used, and the meters mapped to them. This is the main functionality of Distil, and works as a way to make usable piece of usage data out of ceilometer samples.

We are also able to configure metadata fetching from the samples via collection > metadata_def, with the ability to pull from multiple metadata fields as the same data can be in different field names based on sample origin.

### Transformers

Active transformers are currently hard coded as a dict of names to classes, but adding additional transformers is a straightforward process assuming new transformers follow the same input/output conventions of the existing ones. Once listed under the active transformers dict, they can be used and referenced in the config.


## Setup

Provided all the requirements are met, a database must be created, and then setup with artifice/initdb.py

The web app itself consists of running bin/web.py with specified config, at which point you will have the app running locally at: http://0.0.0.0:8000/

### Setup with Openstack environment
As mentioned, Distil relies entirely on the Ceilometer project for its metering and measurement collection.

It needs to be given admin access, and provided with the keystone endpoint in the config.

Currently it also relies on the "state" metric existing in Ceilometer, but that will be patched out later. As well as a few other pollster we've made for it.

### Setup in Production

Puppet install to setup as mod_wsgi app.
More details to come.

## Using Distil

Distil comes with a command-line tool to provide some simple commands. These are mainly commands as accessible via the web api, and they can be used from command-line, or by importing the client module and using it in python.

IMPORTANT: Distil assumes all incoming datetimes are in UTC, conversion from local timezone must occur before passing to the api.

### Web Api

The web app is a rest style api for starting usage collection, and for generating sales orders, drafts, and regenerating sales orders.

#### Commands

* /collect_usage
    * runs usage collection on all tenants present in Keystone

* /sales_order
    * generate a sales order for a given tenant from the last generated sales order, or the first ever usage entry.
        * tenant - tenant id for a given tenant, required.
        * end - end date for the sales order (yyyy-mm-dd), defaults to 00:00:00 UTC for the current date.

* /sales_draft
    * same as generating a sales order, but does not create the sales order in the database.
        * tenant - tenant id for a given tenant, required.
        * end - end date for the sales order (yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy-mm-ddThh-mm-ss), defaults to now in UTC.

* /sales_historic
    * regenerate a sales order for a tenant that intersects with the given date
        * tenant - tenant id for a given tenant, required.
        * date - target date (yyyy-mm-dd).

* /sales_range
    * get all sales orders that intersect with the given range
        * tenant - tenant id for a given tenant, required.
        * start - start of the range (yyyy-mm-dd).
        * end - end of the range (yyyy-mm-dd), defaults to now in UTC.

### Client/Command-line

The client is a simple object that once given a target endpoint for the web api, provides functions that match the web api.

The command-line tool is the same, and has relatively comprehensive help text from the command-line.


## Running Tests

The tests are currently expected to run with Nosetests, against a pre-provisioned database.

## Future things

Eventually we also want Distil to:

  * Authenticate via Keystone
  * Have a public endpoint on keystone, with commands limited by user role and tenant.
  * Have separate usage collection from the web app layer and a scheduler to handle it.

Things we may eventually want include:

  * Alarms built on top of our hourly usage collection.
  * Horizon page that builds graphs based on billing data, both past(sales order), and present (sales draft).
